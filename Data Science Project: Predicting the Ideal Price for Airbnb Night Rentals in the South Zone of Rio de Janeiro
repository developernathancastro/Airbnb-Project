Description
This project aims to develop a data science model using the ExtraTrees algorithm to predict the ideal price for daily rentals in Airbnb listings located in the charming South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. By analyzing a variety of variables, such as amenities and location, we seek to provide hosts with an accurate and reliable estimate to determine the appropriate rent amount.

The South Zone of Rio de Janeiro is one of the most attractive regions for tourists and travelers, with its beautiful beaches, stunning landscapes and proximity to iconic sights, such as Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf Mountain. However, defining the right price for the daily rental in Airbnb listings can be challenging, as there are several factors that influence the value, such as the number of rooms, proximity to beaches, restaurants and public transport, as well as specific characteristics of the each property.

Using advanced data science techniques and the ExtraTrees algorithm, we will do an exploratory analysis of the available data, identifying the main characteristics that affect the rental price in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro for listings on Airbnb. We will then develop a predictive model using ExtraTrees that will take these characteristics into account, providing an accurate estimate of the ideal rental price per night.

In addition, we will apply data visualization techniques to create intuitive and informative charts that allow a clear understanding of the patterns and trends present in the analyzed data. This way, hosts can make informed decisions and maximize the potential of their listings on Airbnb.

Main Stages of the Project
Data collection and preparation: We will collect data on rental per night listings available on Airbnb in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro, along with information about its amenities and location. Next, we'll clean and transform the data, ensuring it's ready for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis: We will perform a detailed analysis of the collected data, identifying relevant patterns, relationships and characteristics that may impact the daily rental price. We will use data visualization techniques to facilitate the understanding of this information.

Predictive model development: Using the ExtraTrees algorithm, we will build a regression model capable of predicting the ideal rental price per night based on the characteristics of Airbnb listings. We will make adjustments and optimizations to the model to ensure its accuracy and performance.

Model evaluation and validation: We will evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques. We will also make comparisons with other models and approaches, ensuring that the developed model is reliable and effective in predicting the ideal rental price per night.
